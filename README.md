# Book Store Application

I have put many features in this project, where the user can
create a new account, register on the site, buy books,
delete them from the shopping cart, modify their quantity,
pay on arrival or through a PayPal account, and if he
encounters any problem, he can send a message on
Through the contact page, the user can also add a picture
for his account or change the password and log out. The
admin can add books to the site, see the messages that
customers send, and see the number of site users and their
emails

## Technology:
The application is built with:
Node js, Express, Pug, MongoDB, Bootstrap4
